      Hello! I am Bdogz, nice to meet you!


      I am 25, use he / him pronouns, and have two cats and two ferrets! I am
      involved with a few small scale low effort projects to bring mirrors of
      posts from Twitter to Bluesky.


      I also play in a band, although we have been on semi-hiatus for a while.


      I am a big game person, I love to build PC's, I collect games for a
      living, and I get involved with many things.


      I also tend to use reaction images a lot


      im not sure what else to put here this is just temporary until i get help
      from my programmer friends to get this set up right LMAO


      \*\*BDOGZ STINKS AT DOING THIS BUT I DID IT ENOUGH FOR NOW\*\*
